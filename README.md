## About the Plugin

The BatchCreate Add-on for Adobe Express is designed to simplify the process of updating text elements across Adobe Express projects. By leveraging a CSV file, users can apply batch replacements to text fields, making it especially useful for projects with repetitive text updates.

## Tampermonkey Script

The plugin requires a Tampermonkey script to duplicate the first (template) page of your project. You can find the [script](https://github.com/daimaukr/ae-batchcreate-plugin-documentation/raw/main/tampermonkey/duplicateButton.user.js) and installation [instructions here](#).
As well there is a other more straigthforward approach to execute duplication from browser developer console. It has been described in [documentation here as well](#).
